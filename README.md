# Enterprise Management Analytics System (EMAS)

A centralized end-to-end analytics and operations data platform designed to support heavy manufacturing organizations. EMAS uses Snowflake, SQL, and Microsoft Access to model manufacturing operations, supply chain logistics, dealer networks, and fleet maintenance. The system centralizes operational data, transforms it into standardized analytics, and exposes insights through lightweight operational tools, mirroring real-world enterprise data workflows.
